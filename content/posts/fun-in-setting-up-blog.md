title: "Fun in Setting Up a Blog"

I created this five years ago and then haven't written any posts.
To be honest, I didn't know what to write about, nor did I have the energy to do so.
What I realized now though is that I quite enjoy the thrill of setting up the infrastructure to be the fun part.
That probably reflects in my professional work as well, being a Python developer but also being heavily involved in infrastructure.

So perhaps this can be motivation that it's ok to setup a blog and not post, or that you can just setup a silly single-purpose website just for the fun of it.
You can get a cheap domain, setup GitHub or Cloudflare Pages, and have a lot of fun with that, and learn a bunch.
For instance, I have my [CV website](https://jeremy.mayeres.be) running with Jekyll and this blog set up with Hugo.
The build process is quite different between them (Jekyll requires a lot more messing with Ruby versions), but that makes it interesting.

So, will I be writing more? Who knows, time will tell.
This is probably still a good idea to write down things I've learned so it doesn't get lost.
I'm also getting more into 3D printing, so if I'm waiting on a print maybe I can write up a post about what I've done.
